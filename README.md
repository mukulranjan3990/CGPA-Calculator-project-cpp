🔢 Calculation Formula
GPA Calculation:
text
GPA = Σ(Grade Points × Credit Hours) / Σ(Credit Hours)
Grade Points Calculation:
text
Grade Points = Individual Course Grade Points × Credit Hours

🗂️ Data Storage Format
The application uses a structured text file format:

Student information (name, roll number, semester)

Course details (name, code, credits, marks, grades)

Calculated values (GPA, CGPA, total credits)

🧪 Testing
The system includes comprehensive validation:

Input Validation: Marks range (0-100), positive credit hours

Data Integrity: Automatic backup and recovery

Error Handling: File I/O errors, invalid inputs

Performance Testing: Tested with 100+ student records
